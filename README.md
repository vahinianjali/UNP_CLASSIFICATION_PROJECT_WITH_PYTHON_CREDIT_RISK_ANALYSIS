# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_CREDIT_RISK_ANALYSIS

As part of my value added course with United Network of Professionals (UNP EDUCATION), I developed a Credit Risk Classification Model using Python to predict the likelihood of credit approval based on customer demographics, financial behavior, and credit history. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, correcting data types, mapping categorical variables, and treating outliers using the IQR method. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) identified key factors such as Prior Default, Credit Score, Years Employed, and Income that significantly influenced loan approval outcomes. Multiple machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were trained and evaluated across different data splits. This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical analysis, and model evaluation, providing practical experience in applying data science techniques for financial risk assessment.
